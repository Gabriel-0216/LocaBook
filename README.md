Nascimento.Software | LocaBook Project


this is a project just to learn and practice .NET coding skills, in this project I use CQRS pattern with MediatR, Dependency Injection, Docker, JWT Authentication, 
EF Core DB-First, FluentAPI.

I forgot to save the DB script *sorry :( *, so you'll need to add a migration with EF Core, just remember to change the connection string in appsettings.json, [Api project]
